# jni: Complete JNI raw bindings

This package includes Haskell bindings to the
[Java Native Interface (JNI)][jni]. This package offers mostly
unopinionated low-level bindings, which closely maps to the C API. For
higher-level more opinionated bindings see the [jvm][haskell-jvm] and
[inline-java][inline-java] packages.
